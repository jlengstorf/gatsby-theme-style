# Gatsby Theme: Styling Abstracted Data

This is a simplified theme that _only_ handles styling data. It relies on the data abstraction in [`@jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-data](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-data).

Eventually, a post explaining how this works will be posted at <https://lengstorf.com/code/data-abstraction-in-apps/>
